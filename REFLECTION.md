TODO: There is a brief description of the application in REFLECTION.md that highlights the key design decisions for the application. The document also contains a reflection of possible improvements that should be done to improve the performance of the application.

# Redis Streams

Decided to use redis for streams and grader load balancing because I do not have any experience with any other streams implementation and we already used Redis in the course
Would it be better to have wake up functionality for the grader-api consumer? "implement wake up functionality upon submission through GradingButton, which starts the consumer for a certain amount of time"

# Design

not optimized for small screens
