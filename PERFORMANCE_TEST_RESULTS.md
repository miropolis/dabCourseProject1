## Reflection

Brief reflection on the results of the tests:

Retrieving the assignment page is rather fast and normally takes less than a millisecond. Submitting assignments through the /api/grade endpoint however is quite slow and takes around 45ms (median). One reason for this is that in the submitting assignment test we are submitting unique submissions (through the iteration counter), so they have to be written to the database each time. If I just submitted assignments with the same code over and over then it would be a lot faster because the database write would be skipped.
